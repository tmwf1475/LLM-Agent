If successfully exploited, an attacker could then install programs or view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.What causes the vulnerability?The vulnerability is caused by the Windows Server service not properly handling specially crafted RPC requests.What is the Server service?The Server service provides RPC support, file and print support, and named pipe sharing over the network. The Server service allows the sharing of your local resources (such as disks and printers) so that other users on the network can access them. It also allows named pipe communication between applications running on other computers and your computer, which is used for RPC.What is RPC?Remote Procedure Call (RPC)",
    "on other computers and your computer, which is used for RPC.What is RPC?Remote Procedure Call (RPC) is a protocol that a program can use to request a service from a program located on another computer in a network. RPC helps with interoperability because the program using RPC does not have to understand the network protocols that are supporting communication. In RPC, the requesting program is the client and the service-providing program is the server.What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of the affected system.How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?An attacker could try to exploit the vulnerability by sending a specially crafted message to an affected system.

Blocking them at the firewall will help protect systems that are behind that firewall from attempts to exploit this vulnerability. Also, make sure that you block any other specifically configured RPC port on the remote system. Microsoft recommends that you block all unsolicited inbound communication from the Internet to help prevent attacks that may use other ports.

    "How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by crafting and sending a malicious print request to a vulnerable system that has a print spooler interface exposed over RPC. The target system would not properly validate whether the remote user has sufficient permissions, and permit the remote attacker to create a file in a Windows system directory. When dropped in particular locations, these files may be automatically executed by the system.",
    "What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?Workstations and terminal servers that share a printer, or print servers are primarily at risk. Servers could be at more risk if administrators allow users to log on to servers and to run programs. However, best practices strongly discourage allowing this.\nWhat does the update do?The update addresses the vulnerability by correcting the manner in which the Printer Spooler service validates user permissions to access print spoolers.\nWhen this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?Yes.

No users should be assigned administrative access unless absolutely needed. Those with a need for administrator accounts should only use them when necessary.Configure access controls including file, directory, and network share permissions with least privilege in mind. If a user only needs to read specific files, they should not have write access to those files, directories, or shares.Disable macro scripts from Microsoft Office files transmitted via email.

Ideally, run these as often as possible and practical.Test your backups to ensure they work correctly upon use.Recommendations for Network ProtectionApply the patch (MS17-010). If the patch cannot be applied, consider:Disabling SMBv1 andblocking all versions of SMB at the network boundary by blocking TCP port 445 with related protocols on UDP ports 137-138 and TCP port 139, for all boundary devices.Note:disabling or blocking SMB may create problems by obstructing access to shared files, data, or devices.

Implement the",
    "are set to automatically conduct regular scans.Manage the use of privileged accounts. Implement the principle of least privilege. No users should be assigned administrative access unless absolutely needed. Those with a need for administrator accounts should only use them when necessary.Configure access controls including file, directory, and network share permissions with least privilege in mind. If a user only needs to read specific files, they should not have write access to those files, directories, or shares.Disable macro scripts from Microsoft Office files transmitted via email. Consider using Office Viewer software to open Microsoft Office files transmitted via email instead of full Office suite applications.Develop, institute, and practice employee education programs for",

Ideally, run these as often as possible and practical.Test your backups to ensure they work correctly upon use.Recommendations for Network ProtectionApply the patch (MS17-010). If the patch cannot be applied, consider:Disabling SMBv1 andblocking all versions of SMB at the network boundary by blocking TCP port 445 with related protocols on UDP ports 137-138 and TCP port 139, for all boundary devices.Note:disabling or blocking SMB may create problems by obstructing access to shared files, data, or devices. The benefits of mitigation should be weighed",
    "obstructing access to shared files, data, or devices. The benefits of mitigation should be weighed against potential disruptions to users.Review US-CERT s Alert onThe Increasing Threat to Network Infrastructure Devices and Recommended Mitigationsand consider implementing the following best practices:Segregate networks and functions.Limit unnecessary lateral communications.Harden network devices.Secure access to infrastructure devices.Perform out-of-band network management.Validate integrity of hardware and software.Recommended Steps for RemediationContact law enforcement.

    "Maintain and provide relevant logs.Implement your security incident response and business continuity plan. Ideally, organizations should ensure they have appropriate backups so their response is simply to restore the data from a known clean backup.Defending Against Ransomware GenerallyPrecautionary measures to mitigate ransomware threats include:Ensure anti-virus software is up-to-date.Implement a data back-up and recovery plan to maintain copies of sensitive or proprietary data in a separate and secure location.

AA20-352A primarily focuses on an advanced persistent threat (APT) actor s compromise of SolarWinds Orion products as an initial access vector into networks of U.S. Government agencies, critical infrastructure entities, and private network organizations. As noted in AA20-352A, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has evidence of initial access vectors in addition to the compromised SolarWinds Orion products.This Alert also addresses activity irrespective of the initial access vector leveraged that CISA attributes to an APT actor.

CISA has also seen this APT actor utilizing additional credentials and Application Programming Interface (API) access to cloud resources of private and public sector organizations. These tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) feature three key components:Compromising or bypassing federated identity solutions;Using forged authentication tokens to move laterally to Microsoft cloud environments; andUsing privileged access to a victim s cloud environment to establish difficult-to-detect persistence mechanisms for Application Programming Interface (API)-based access.This Alert describes these TTPs and offers an overview of, and guidance on, available",

Primarily, the amount of telemetry retention is far less than the traditional logging facilities of on-premises data sources. Threat actor activity that is more than 90 days old is unlikely to have been saved by traditional sources or be visible with the Microsoft M365 Management API or in the UAL.Service principal logging is available using the Azure Portal via the \"Service Principal Sign-ins\" feature.

Primarily, the amount of telemetry retention is far less than the traditional logging facilities of on-premises data sources. Threat actor activity that is more than 90 days old is unlikely to have been saved by traditional sources or be visible with the Microsoft M365 Management API or in the UAL.Service principal logging is available using the Azure Portal via the \"Service Principal Sign-ins\" feature.
