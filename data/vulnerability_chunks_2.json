The Shell organizes these objects into a hierarchical namespace and provides users and applications with a consistent and efficient way to access and manage objects.What is a shortcut?A shortcut is a link to a file or program, represented by an icon. If you double-click a shortcut, the file or program opens. The shortcut is a mechanism often used to keep frequently used files in a single, easily accessed location, such as a folder or the desktop. Shortcuts are implemented as files with the LNK extension. In addition, shortcuts can also appear as PIF files when they are related to MS-DOS programs.Will this security update disable the workaround or Microsoft Fix it solution, if I have previously implemented it?No, the workaround and Microsoft",
    "or Microsoft Fix it solution, if I have previously implemented it?No, the workaround and Microsoft Fix it solution operate independently from the security update. After the security update has been implemented, users who have applied the workaround need to undo it.What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code as the logged-on user. If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker could take complete control of the affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with",
    "to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?An attacker could present a removable drive to the user with a malicious shortcut file, and an associated malicious binary. When the user opens this drive in Windows Explorer, or any other application that parses the icon of the shortcut, the malicious binary will execute code of the attacker s choice on the target system.An attacker could also set up a malicious Web site or a remote network share and place the malicious components on this remote location. When the user browses the Web site using a Web browser such as Internet Explorer or a file manager such as Windows Explorer, Windows attempts to load the icon of the",
    "Explorer or a file manager such as Windows Explorer, Windows attempts to load the icon of the shortcut file, invoking the malicious binary. In addition, an attacker could embed an exploit in a document that supports embedded shortcuts or a hosted browser control (such as but not limited to Microsoft Office documents).What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?Desktop systems used to browse untrusted network shares or untrusted Web sites are most at risk from this vulnerability.What does the update do?The update addresses this vulnerability by correctly validating the icon reference of a shortcut.When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?Yes.

It contains the window manager, which controls window displays; manages screen output; collects input from the keyboard, mouse, and other devices; and passes",
    "manages screen output; collects input from the keyboard, mouse, and other devices; and passes user messages to applications. It also contains the Graphics Device Interface (GDI), which is a library of functions for graphics output devices. Finally, it serves as a wrapper for DirectX support that is implemented in another driver (dxgkrnl.sys).What is the Windows kernel?The Windows kernel is the core of the operating system. It provides system-level services such as device management and memory management, allocates processor time to processes, and manages error handling.What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?In most scenarios, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could achieve elevation of privilege on the target system.It is also theoretically possible,",
    "could achieve elevation of privilege on the target system.It is also theoretically possible, but unlikely due to memory randomization, that an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could achieve remote code execution. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full administrative rights.Why is code execution unlikely for this issue?An attacker who attempts to exploit this issue for code execution would need to write executable content to a specific space in kernel memory. However, since the starting address will be random, the final pointer destination will be difficult to predict. The implementation of Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) by default on affected systems further complicates this prediction. In",
    "Layout Randomization (ASLR) by default on affected systems further complicates this prediction. In most scenarios, exploit code could much more likely result in elevation of privilege than in code execution.How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?There are multiple means that could allow an attacker to exploit this vulnerability:In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a specially crafted website that is designed to exploit this vulnerability through Internet Explorer and then convince a user to view the website. The attacker could also take advantage of compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements. These websites could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an",

Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to take action, typically by getting them to click a link in an email message or in an Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's website, or by opening an attachment sent through email.In a local attack scenario, an attacker could also exploit this vulnerability by running a specially crafted application to take complete control over the affected system. However, the attacker must have valid logon credentials and be able to log on locally to exploit this vulnerability in this scenario.What systems are primarily at risk from the",

    "A theoretical remote code execution vulnerability exists when the Windows kernel-mode driver improperly handles objects in memory. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability as a remote code execution vulnerability could execute arbitrary code in the security context of the Windows kernel. However, since the remote attack vector is not likely, it is more likely that an attacker would first need to log on to the target system to successfully exploit this vulnerability and gain elevated privileges.\nTo view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, seeCVE-2013-3660.\nMicrosoft has not identified any mitigating factors for this vulnerability.\nMicrosoft has not identified any workarounds for this vulnerability.",
    "Microsoft has not identified any workarounds for this vulnerability.\nWhat is the scope of the vulnerability?This is a theoretical remote code execution vulnerability.

Please read the following FAQ for a more complete understanding of this vulnerability.\nWhat causes the vulnerability?The vulnerability is caused when the Windows kernel-mode driver improperly handles objects in memory.\nWhat might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?In most scenarios, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could achieve elevation of privilege on the target system.",
    "It is also theoretically possible, but unlikely due to memory randomization, that an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could achieve remote code execution. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full administrative rights.",
    "Why is code execution unlikely for this issue?An attacker who attempts to exploit this issue for code execution would need to write executable content to a specific space in kernel memory. However, since the starting address will be random, the final pointer destination will be difficult to predict. The implementation of Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) by default on affected systems further complicates this prediction. In most scenarios, exploit code could much more likely result in elevation of privilege than in code execution.\nHow could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?There are multiple means that could allow an attacker to exploit this vulnerability:",
    "In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a specially crafted website that is designed to exploit this vulnerability through Internet Explorer and then convince a user to view the website. The attacker could also take advantage of compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements. These websites could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to view the attacker-controlled content. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to take action, typically by getting them to click a link in an email message or in an Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's website, or by opening an attachment sent through email.",

AA20-352A primarily focuses on an advanced persistent threat (APT) actor s compromise of SolarWinds Orion products as an initial access vector into networks of U.S. Government agencies, critical infrastructure entities, and private network organizations. As noted in AA20-352A, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has evidence of initial access vectors in addition to the compromised SolarWinds Orion products.This Alert also addresses activity irrespective of the initial access vector leveraged that CISA attributes to an APT actor.

These tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) feature three key components:Compromising or bypassing federated identity solutions;Using forged authentication tokens to move laterally to Microsoft cloud environments; andUsing privileged access to a victim s cloud environment to establish difficult-to-detect persistence mechanisms for Application Programming Interface (API)-based access.This Alert describes these TTPs and offers an overview of, and guidance on, available",

Primarily, the amount of telemetry retention is far less than the traditional logging facilities of on-premises data sources. Threat actor activity that is more than 90 days old is unlikely to have been saved by traditional sources or be visible with the Microsoft M365 Management API or in the UAL.Service principal logging is available using the Azure Portal via the \"Service Principal Sign-ins\" feature.

AA20-352A primarily focuses on an advanced persistent threat (APT) actor s compromise of SolarWinds Orion products as an initial access vector into networks of U.S. Government agencies, critical infrastructure entities, and private network organizations. As noted in AA20-352A, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has evidence of initial access vectors in addition to the compromised SolarWinds Orion products.This Alert also addresses activity irrespective of the initial access vector leveraged that CISA attributes to an APT actor.

These tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) feature three key components:Compromising or bypassing federated identity solutions;Using forged authentication tokens to move laterally to Microsoft cloud environments; andUsing privileged access to a victim s cloud environment to establish difficult-to-detect persistence mechanisms for Application Programming Interface (API)-based access.This Alert describes these TTPs and offers an overview of, and guidance on, available",

Primarily, the amount of telemetry retention is far less than the traditional logging facilities of on-premises data sources. Threat actor activity that is more than 90 days old is unlikely to have been saved by traditional sources or be visible with the Microsoft M365 Management API or in the UAL.Service principal logging is available using the Azure Portal via the \"Service Principal Sign-ins\" feature.

CISA continues to analyze the threat actor s follow-on objectives.Technical DetailsFrequently, CISA has observed the APT actor gainingInitial Access[TA0001] to victims  enterprise networks via compromised SolarWinds Orion products (e.g., Solorigate, Sunburst).[1]However, CISA is investigating instances in which the threat actor may have obtained initial access byPassword Guessing[T1110.001],Password Spraying[T1110.003], and/or exploiting",

    "without having those claims checked against the identity provider and then to move laterally to Microsoft Cloud environments (Lateral Movement[TA0008]).The threat actor has also used on-premises access to manipulate and bypass identity controls and multi-factor authentication. This activity demonstrates how sophisticated adversaries can use credentials from one portion of an organization to move laterally (Lateral Movement[TA0008]) through trust boundaries, evade defenses and detection (Defense Evasion[TA0005]), and steal sensitive data (Collection[TA0009]).This level of compromise is challenging to remediate and requires a rigorous multi-disciplinary effort to regain administrative control before recovering.MitigationsDetectionGuidance on identifying affected SolarWinds software is well",

Microsoft's O365 and M365 environments have built-in capabilities for detecting unusual activity.

Microsoft describes these stages as beginning with all activity after the compromise of the on-premises identity solution, such as ADFS.[6]Note: this step provides an entry vector to cloud technology environments, and is unnecessary when the threat actor has compromised an identity solution or credential that allows the APT direct access to",
    "actor has compromised an identity solution or credential that allows the APT direct access to the cloud(e.g., without leveraging the SolarWinds Orion vulnerability).Stage 1: Forging a trusted authentication token used to access resources that trust the on-premises identity providerThese attacks (often referred to as  Golden Security Assertion Markup Language  attacks) can be analyzed using a combination of cloud-based and standard on-premises techniques.[7]For example, network defenders can useOAuthclaims for specific principals made at the Azure AD level and compare them to the on-premises identity.Export sign-in logs from the Azure AD portal and look at the Authentication Method field.Note: at portal.azure.com, click on a user and review the authentication details (e.g., date, method,",
    "at portal.azure.com, click on a user and review the authentication details (e.g., date, method, result). Without Sentinel, this is the only way to get these logs, which are critical for this effort.Detection Method 1: Correlating service provider login events with corresponding authentication events in Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS) and Domain ControllersUsing SAML single sign-on, search for any logins to service providers that do not have corresponding event IDs 4769, 1200, and 1202 in the domain.Detection Method 2: Identifying certificate export events in ADFSLook for:Detection Method 3: Customizing SAML response to identify irregular accessThis method serves as prevention for the future (and would only detect future, not past, activity), as it helps identify irregularities",

Organizations can modify SAML responses to include custom elements for each service provider to monitor and detect any anomalous requests.[8]Detection Method 4: Detecting malicious ADFS trust modificationA threat actor who gains administrative access to ADFS can add a new, trusted ADFS rather than extracting the certificate and private key as part of a standard Golden SAML attack.[9]Network defenders should look for:Stage 2: Using the forged authentication token to create configuration changes in the Service Provider, such as Azure AD (establishing a foothold)After the threat actor has compromised the on-premises identity provider, they identify their",

Once the threat actor has impersonated a privileged Azure AD account, they are likely to further manipulate the Azure/M365 environment (action on objectives in the cloud).Network defenders should take the following steps.Stage 3: Acquiring anOAuthaccess token for the application using the forged credentials added to an existing application or service principal and calling APIs with the permissions",

Primarily, the amount of telemetry retention is far less than the traditional logging facilities of on-premises data sources. Threat actor activity that is more than 90 days old is unlikely to have been saved by traditional sources or be visible with the Microsoft M365 Management API or in the UAL.Service principal logging is available using the Azure Portal via the \"Service Principal Sign-ins\" feature.

    "Standard G3/E3 licenses only provide 90 days of auditing; with the advanced auditing license that is provided with a G5/E5 license, audit logs can be extended to retain information for a year. CISA notes that this license change is proactive, rather than reactive: it allows enhanced visibility and features for telemetry from the moment of integration but does not provide retroactive visibility on previous events or historical context.A properly configured SIEM can provide:Built-in tools, such as Microsoft Cloud Services and M365 applications, provide much of the same visibility available from custom tools and are mapped to the MITRE ATT&CK framework and easy-to-understand dashboards.[14]However, these tools often do not have the ability to pull historical data older than seven days.",

Microsoft describes these stages as beginning with all activity after the compromise of the on-premises identity solution, such as ADFS.[6]Note: this step provides an entry vector to cloud technology environments, and is unnecessary when the threat actor has compromised an identity solution or credential that allows the APT direct access to",
    "actor has compromised an identity solution or credential that allows the APT direct access to the cloud(e.g., without leveraging the SolarWinds Orion vulnerability).Stage 1: Forging a trusted authentication token used to access resources that trust the on-premises identity providerThese attacks (often referred to as  Golden Security Assertion Markup Language  attacks) can be analyzed using a combination of cloud-based and standard on-premises techniques.[7]For example, network defenders can useOAuthclaims for specific principals made at the Azure AD level and compare them to the on-premises identity.Export sign-in logs from the Azure AD portal and look at the Authentication Method field.Note: at portal.azure.com, click on a user and review the authentication details (e.g., date, method,",

Without Sentinel, this is the only way to get these logs, which are critical for this effort.Detection Method 1: Correlating service provider login events with corresponding authentication events in Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS) and Domain ControllersUsing SAML single sign-on, search for any logins to service providers that do not have corresponding event IDs 4769, 1200, and 1202 in the domain.Detection Method 2: Identifying certificate export events in ADFSLook for:Detection Method 3: Customizing SAML response to identify irregular accessThis method serves as prevention for the future (and would only detect future, not past, activity), as it helps identify irregularities",
    "the future (and would only detect future, not past, activity), as it helps identify irregularities from the point of the change forward. Organizations can modify SAML responses to include custom elements for each service provider to monitor and detect any anomalous requests.[8]Detection Method 4: Detecting malicious ADFS trust modificationA threat actor who gains administrative access to ADFS can add a new, trusted ADFS rather than extracting the certificate and private key as part of a standard Golden SAML attack.[9]Network defenders should look for:Stage 2: Using the forged authentication token to create configuration changes in the Service Provider, such as Azure AD (establishing a foothold)After the threat actor has compromised the on-premises identity provider, they identify their",

Once the threat actor has impersonated a privileged Azure AD account, they are likely to further manipulate the Azure/M365 environment (action on objectives in the cloud).Network defenders should take the following steps.Stage 3: Acquiring anOAuthaccess token for the application using the forged credentials added to an existing application or service principal and calling APIs with the permissions",

Primarily, the amount of telemetry retention is far less than the traditional logging facilities of on-premises data sources. Threat actor activity that is more than 90 days old is unlikely to have been saved by traditional sources or be visible with the Microsoft M365 Management API or in the UAL.Service principal logging is available using the Azure Portal via the \"Service Principal Sign-ins\" feature.

See theATT&CK for Enterprisefor all referenced threat actor tactics and techniques.Updated April 15, 2021: The U.S. Government attributes this activity to the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR). Additional information may be found in astatement from the White House. For more information on SolarWinds-related activity, go tohttps://us-cert.cisa.gov/remediating-apt-compromised-networksandhttps://www.cisa.gov/supply-chain-compromise.This Alert is a companion alert toAA20-352A: Advanced Persistent Threat Compromise of Government Agencies,",
    "is a companion alert toAA20-352A: Advanced Persistent Threat Compromise of Government Agencies, Critical Infrastructure, and Private Sector Organizations. AA20-352A primarily focuses on an advanced persistent threat (APT) actor s compromise of SolarWinds Orion products as an initial access vector into networks of U.S. Government agencies, critical infrastructure entities, and private network organizations. As noted in AA20-352A, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has evidence of initial access vectors in addition to the compromised SolarWinds Orion products.This Alert also addresses activity irrespective of the initial access vector leveraged that CISA attributes to an APT actor. Specifically, CISA has seen an APT actor using compromised applications in a victim s",
    "an APT actor. Specifically, CISA has seen an APT actor using compromised applications in a victim s Microsoft 365 (M365)/Azure environment. CISA has also seen this APT actor utilizing additional credentials and Application Programming Interface (API) access to cloud resources of private and public sector organizations. These tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) feature three key components:Compromising or bypassing federated identity solutions;Using forged authentication tokens to move laterally to Microsoft cloud environments; andUsing privileged access to a victim s cloud environment to establish difficult-to-detect persistence mechanisms for Application Programming Interface (API)-based access.This Alert describes these TTPs and offers an overview of, and guidance on, available",
    "access.This Alert describes these TTPs and offers an overview of, and guidance on, available open-source tools including a CISA-developed tool, Sparrow for network defenders to analyze their Microsoft Azure Active Directory (AD), Office 365 (O365), and M365 environments to detect potentially malicious activity.Note: this Alert describes artifacts presented by these attacks from which CISA has identified detectable evidence of the threat actor s initial objectives. CISA continues to analyze the threat actor s follow-on objectives.Technical DetailsFrequently, CISA has observed the APT actor gainingInitial Access[TA0001] to victims  enterprise networks via compromised SolarWinds Orion products (e.g., Solorigate, Sunburst).[1]However, CISA is investigating instances in which the threat actor",

This enumeration allows threat actors to forge authentication tokens (OAuth) to issue",
    "capability. This enumeration allows threat actors to forge authentication tokens (OAuth) to issue claims to service providers without having those claims checked against the identity provider and then to move laterally to Microsoft Cloud environments (Lateral Movement[TA0008]).The threat actor has also used on-premises access to manipulate and bypass identity controls and multi-factor authentication. This activity demonstrates how sophisticated adversaries can use credentials from one portion of an organization to move laterally (Lateral Movement[TA0008]) through trust boundaries, evade defenses and detection (Defense Evasion[TA0005]), and steal sensitive data (Collection[TA0009]).This level of compromise is challenging to remediate and requires a rigorous multi-disciplinary effort to",

Microsoft's O365 and M365 environments have built-in capabilities for detecting unusual activity.

    "CVE-IDCVE-2023-42811Learn more at National Vulnerability Database (NVD)  CVSS Severity Rating   Fix Information   Vulnerable Software Versions   SCAP Mappings   CPE InformationDescriptionaes-gcm is a pure Rust implementation of the AES-GCM. Starting in version 0.10.0 and prior to version 0.10.3, in the AES GCM implementation of decrypt_in_place_detached, the decrypted ciphertext (i.e. the correct plaintext) is exposed even if tag verification fails. If a program using the `aes-gcm` crate's `decrypt_in_place*` APIs accesses the buffer after decryption failure, it will contain a decryption of an unauthenticated input. Depending on the specific nature of the program this may enable Chosen Ciphertext Attacks (CCAs) which can cause a catastrophic breakage of the cipher including full plaintext",
